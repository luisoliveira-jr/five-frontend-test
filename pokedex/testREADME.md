# Frontend Challenge

Hello!

#### We are happy that you are interested in joining our team! We created a challenge based on some skills we use in our daily lives to get to know a little more about you.

# Pokemon website

### Rules

In this challenge you must use React with Typescript as the main development tool. For styling, common CSS as well as preprocessors,
CSS in JS and inline CSS frameworks and libraries are appreciated. Dependencies for routes and api call management
are also allowed.  
Pay attention to your configurations and dependencies, projects that do not compile or does not boot up will be ignored.  
If your project demands any custom configurations, you must provide a README.md file with the instructions to execute
the application.

## On this test

You will have to consume the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/) to build a website containing 3 main pages.

### PAGES

* login page: This page shall contain fields for email and password (to be stored via local storage and simulate an
authentication) or use an external login method (github, google, etc).
* pokemon view: This page shall have filters (element type, species name and generation) to search pokemons and, using
pagination, list the pokemon species results, and if authenticated, show the option to add the pokemon to the user's
list on each pokemon card.
* profile view (authenticated only): This page shall have the user info (name, email/github profile link) and the list
of the user's pokemons, with the option to remove any pokemon from the list.  

**ERROR HANDLING:** It is very important that there are cases to treat errors on the application, like authentication errors,
empty response errors, etc.

**STYLING:** We do not provide a standard layout to be following during development, meaning the style of the app shall
follow your personal taste, given that it is user-friendly and responsive.

#### Bonus (optional) :star2:
Write unit tests using [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) or [Jest](https://jestjs.io/pt-BR/)
